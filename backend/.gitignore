# ============================================================
# LESSON: .gitignore - Files NOT to commit to Git
# ============================================================
#
# Git tracks all files by default. This file tells Git which
# files/folders to IGNORE (not track).
#
# Why ignore files?
# 1. Security: .env contains passwords!
# 2. Size: vendor/ can be 100MB+ (install with composer install)
# 3. Generated: Files that can be recreated
#
# ============================================================

# Dependencies (install with: composer install)
