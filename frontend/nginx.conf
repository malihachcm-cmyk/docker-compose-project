# ============================================================
# NGINX CONFIG FOR REACT SPA (Single Page Application)
# ============================================================
#
# PROBLEM: React uses client-side routing (React Router)
# When user visits /about, the browser requests /about from server
# But /about doesn't exist as a file! Only index.html exists.
#
# SOLUTION: Always serve index.html, let React handle routing
# ============================================================

server {
    # Listen on port 80 (standard HTTP port)
    listen 80;

    # Where the files are located
    root /usr/share/nginx/html;

    # Default file to serve
    index index.html;

    # Handle all requests
    location / {
        # "try_files" tries options in order:
        # 1. $uri = Try the exact file requested
        # 2. $uri/ = Try as a directory
        # 3. /index.html = Fallback to index.html (for React Router)
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }

    # Cache static assets for performance
    location ~* \.(js|css|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|ico|svg)$ {
        expires 1y;
        add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable";
    }
}
